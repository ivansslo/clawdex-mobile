# Setup and Operations

This guide is the detailed companion to the top-level `README.md`.

## Choosing Harnesses

The setup wizard now lets you choose which harnesses the phone should control.

If you want Codex, OpenCode, and Cursor:

```bash
clawdex init --engines codex,opencode,cursor
```

From a source checkout, the equivalent command is:

```bash
npm run setup:wizard -- --engines codex,opencode,cursor
```

That writes `BRIDGE_ENABLED_ENGINES=codex,opencode,cursor` into `.env.secure`, so the bridge starts the selected backends and the mobile app can control them from one UI. When Cursor is selected, `clawdex init` asks for the Cursor API key and saves it in `.env.secure`.

If you want only one harness, use `--engine codex`, `--engine opencode`, or `--engine cursor`.

Cursor usage limits are not exposed by Cursor's public API today. The app shows key status, key metadata, runtime state, and models from Cursor; plan or weekly usage details remain in Cursor.

## Onboarding Output Cues

After `clawdex init`, expected sequence:

1. Secure config is written or reused
2. The bridge starts in the background
3. The wizard prints the bridge URL, token, and pairing QR for mobile onboarding
4. Bridge logs are written to `.bridge.log`

Published npm releases bundle prebuilt bridge binaries for `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-armv7l`, and `win32-x64`. On those hosts, normal bridge startup does not require a Rust compile.

`clawdex init` does not run a project-local `npm install` for the published CLI path. The only required npm install there is `npm install -g clawdex-mobile@latest`.

Published CLI installs are bridge-only. They do not include the Expo workspace or mobile app source files.

## GitHub Codespaces Setup

Codespaces can replace a user-managed always-on machine for development and lightweight remote use.

From a repo checkout inside an active codespace:

```bash
npm run setup:wizard
```

Choose `GitHub Codespaces` for the bridge network mode.

What that does:

- binds the bridge locally inside the codespace
- writes `BRIDGE_CONNECT_URL` and `BRIDGE_PREVIEW_CONNECT_URL` using the codespace forwarded HTTPS domain
- enables bridge-side GitHub bearer auth for the current codespace
- starts the bridge normally
- attempts to mark the bridge port and browser-preview port public on each startup

Important constraints:

- Pair the mobile app to the printed `https://<codespace>-8787.app.github.dev` URL, not `127.0.0.1`
- Browser preview uses the preview port (`8788` by default), so that forwarded port must also be public
- GitHub resets public forwarded ports back to private whenever the codespace restarts
- Keep bridge auth enabled and use Codespaces only for repos you trust, because public forwarded ports are internet-reachable
- If the mobile app build sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_AUTH_BASE_URL`, onboarding/settings can now open one GitHub sign-in, start the Codespace, and connect directly with the same GitHub App user token instead of copying `BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Users do not need to grant the GitHub App repository installation access to the `clawdex-codespace` template for the normal Codespaces flow
- The same in-app GitHub flow can create a new Codespace. It prefers `<signed-in-user>/<EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_REPO_NAME>`. If that repo does not exist yet, Clawdex automatically forks `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_SOURCE_OWNER/<EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_REPO_NAME>` into the signed-in user account and creates the Codespace from that fork
- Older saved GitHub Codespaces sessions may need one fresh sign-in from the app so the stored GitHub App token and refresh token are updated

For the one-flow GitHub App setup:

- deploy the tiny auth service under `services/github-app-auth-worker`
- set the GitHub App `Callback URL` to `https://<your-domain>/github/callback`
- set the mobile env `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_AUTH_BASE_URL=https://<your-domain>`

Manual recovery if port visibility does not update automatically:

```bash
gh codespace ports visibility 8787:public 8788:public
```

### Codespaces Bootstrap

The app-created Codespace template uses the prebuilt root devcontainer path (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) by default. That devcontainer includes:

- `updateContentCommand`: installs `clawdex-mobile@internal` and `@openai/codex`
- `postCreateCommand`: starts the packaged bridge bootstrap in the foreground, writing setup output to `.bridge-bootstrap.log`
- `postStartCommand`: reruns the same foreground bootstrap on resume; an already healthy bridge is treated as success
- `waitFor`: `updateContentCommand`

`npm run codespaces:bootstrap` does the following:

- installs the Codex CLI via `npm install -g @openai/codex` if it is missing
- in `--prepare-only` mode, prebuilds the Rust bridge binary without starting it
- rewrites `.env.secure` for `BRIDGE_NETWORK_MODE=codespaces`, `BRIDGE_GITHUB_CODESPACES_AUTH=true`, and the selected engine list
- writes `CODEX_HOME=$HOME/.codex` in Codespaces so Codex-managed ChatGPT auth survives bridge restarts and Codespace wakes
- starts the bridge in the background unless you set `CLAWDEX_CODESPACES_SKIP_START=true` or pass `--no-start`

Clawdex-created Codespaces request a 45-minute idle timeout. The bridge emits a lightweight active-turn keepalive while a Codex, OpenCode, or Cursor turn is running, so active work has activity even if a long step is otherwise quiet. When no turn is running, the keepalive stops and GitHub can pause the Codespace normally to save cost.

That means prebuild-enabled Codespaces can snapshot the expensive package install during `updateContentCommand`. The later `postCreateCommand` starts the runtime bridge during Codespace creation, and the mobile app waits for bridge health before continuing. The template disables bridge-side port publication during bootstrap because the app publishes ports through the GitHub tunnel API before probing `/health`; this keeps post-create startup from blocking on GitHub CLI port commands. `postStartCommand` keeps wake/resume behavior idempotent instead of failing when the bridge is already listening.

The same bootstrap script is included in the published `clawdex-mobile` npm package. That lets the `clawdex-codespace` template stay minimal: it installs `clawdex-mobile@internal` globally in `updateContentCommand` and invokes the packaged bootstrap against the current workspace instead of copying `scripts/*` and `services/rust-bridge/*` into the template repo. Because the published package ships Linux bridge binaries, the template does not need Rust, Cargo, or a local bridge compile.

During first-time mobile setup, the app can start native ChatGPT login while the Codespace bridge is still warming up. Once the bridge becomes reachable, the app replays that ChatGPT token bundle through `account/login/start` with `chatgptAuthTokens`, so Codex can become ready without a separate app-server restart. Reconnecting to an existing Codespace still waits for the bridge first so users are not prompted again when Codex is already authenticated.

Manual examples:

```bash
npm run codespaces:bootstrap -- --prepare-only
npm run codespaces:bootstrap
npm run codespaces:bootstrap -- --no-start
CLAWDEX_CODESPACES_ENGINES=codex,opencode,cursor npm run codespaces:bootstrap
```

Minimal template equivalent:

```bash
npm install -g --no-fund --no-audit clawdex-mobile@internal @openai/codex
CLAWDEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT="$PWD" node "$(npm root -g)/clawdex-mobile/scripts/codespaces-bootstrap.js"
```

## Manual Secure Setup (No Wizard)

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2) Generate secure runtime config

```bash
npm run secure:setup
```

To generate multi-harness config instead:

```bash
BRIDGE_ENABLED_ENGINES=codex,opencode,cursor npm run secure:setup
```

Creates/updates:

- `.env.secure` (bridge runtime config + token)
- `apps/mobile/.env` (repo checkout only, for local mobile dev builds)

### 3) Start bridge

```bash
npm run secure:bridge
```

If you want a one-off multi-harness launch without rewriting `.env.secure`:

```bash
BRIDGE_ENABLED_ENGINES=codex,opencode,cursor npm run secure:bridge
```

When multiple harnesses are selected, the bridge starts each backend and merges chat lists while still routing each thread by engine.

### 4) Pair from the mobile app

Open the installed mobile app on your phone, then scan the bridge QR. If needed, enter the bridge URL manually (for example `http://100.x.y.z:8787`, `http://192.168.x.y:8787`, or `https://<codespace>-8787.app.github.dev`). The chosen bridge URL is stored on-device and can be changed later in Settings.

### In-app Bridge Maintenance

For secure-launcher installs, the mobile Settings screen can trigger bridge maintenance safely.

- Open `Settings > Bridge Maintenance`
- Tap `Restart bridge safely` to stop the current bridge and relaunch it through `scripts/start-bridge-secure.js`
- The app will disconnect briefly while the detached helper waits for bridge health to recover

Published `clawdex-mobile` CLI installs also expose `Update bridge`.

- `Update bridge` stops the current bridge, runs `npm install -g clawdex-mobile@latest`, and starts the bridge again
- If the upgrade step fails, the helper attempts to restart the previous bridge automatically

Source checkouts expose only the restart action because repo-specific update logic is not safe to automate generically from mobile.

## Local Mobile Development Only

If you are developing the mobile app from this repo, start Expo separately:

```bash
npm run mobile
```

`npm run mobile` uses `scripts/start-expo.sh`, which sets `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` from your secure config so QR resolution is predictable.

If you want one command that switches the bridge between LAN/VLAN and Tailscale, preserves your
existing bridge token and enabled harnesses, restarts the bridge in the background, and then opens
Expo:

```bash
npm run stack:lan
npm run stack:tailscale
```

Both wrappers call `scripts/start-mobile-stack.sh`. Pass `--expo ios` or `--expo android` if you
want the same flow but to open a native Expo run command instead of the default `mobile` mode.

## Advanced Knobs

Optional environment variables:

- `CLAWDEX_SETUP_VERBOSE=true` — show full installer output
- `CLAWDEX_BRIDGE_FORCE_SOURCE_BUILD=true` — ignore a bundled bridge binary and build from local Rust sources instead
- `EXPO_AUTO_REPAIR=true` — auto-repair React Native runtime on `npm run mobile`
- `EXPO_CLEAR_CACHE=true` — force `expo start --clear` via `npm run mobile`

## Local Browser Preview

The mobile app includes a `Browser` screen that can open loopback-only web apps from the bridge
machine inside the app itself.

Typical examples:

- `localhost:3000`
- `127.0.0.1:5173`
- `3000`

How it works:

- The app creates a short-lived preview session through the bridge RPC API
- The bridge serves a dedicated preview origin on a separate port
- HTTP requests, subresources, cookies, and WebSocket/HMR traffic are proxied from the phone to
  the bridge host's loopback target
- Browser runtime calls to other loopback origins on the host are also rewritten through the
  preview origin for `fetch`, XHR, `EventSource`, `WebSocket`, and form submissions

Current scope:

- Supports `http://` and `https://` loopback targets only
- Intended for local web dev servers such as Next.js, Vite, CRA, or simple static servers
- Separate local frontend/backend ports can work together inside the preview as long as the app
  reaches the backend through normal browser APIs or form posts
- Hard-coded absolute localhost asset URLs outside those browser APIs may still need a same-origin
  dev proxy in the app itself
- Does not preview native React Native simulator/device UI directly

For a concise list of supported cases and known limitations, see
`docs/browser-preview-limitations.md`.

## Teardown / Cleanup

```bash
npm run teardown
```

Can:

- stop the bridge
- also stop local Expo if you started it from this repo
- remove generated artifacts (`.env.secure`, `.bridge.log`, `.expo.log`, pid files)
- optionally reset `apps/mobile/.env` from `.env.example`
- optionally run `tailscale down`

Non-interactive mode:

```bash
npm run teardown -- --yes
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

- Keep bridge network-private only by default (Tailscale/private LAN/VPN + host firewall)
- If using GitHub Codespaces, remember the bridge is internet-reachable whenever its forwarded ports are public
- Require bridge auth of some kind (`BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` or GitHub Codespaces auth)
- Keep `BRIDGE_ALLOW_QUERY_TOKEN_AUTH=true` only on private networks (required for Android WS auth fallback)
- Do not set `BRIDGE_ALLOW_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` outside local debugging
- Scope `BRIDGE_WORKDIR` to minimal required root
- Use strict default approvals on mobile
- Treat `Session`/`Allow similar` approval actions as privileged
- Run bridge under a supervisor with restart policy
- Rotate bridge tokens periodically and on device loss
- Keep `codex`, Node deps, Expo SDK, and OS patches updated

## Verifying Setup

### Bridge health

```bash
source .env.secure
curl "http://$BRIDGE_HOST:$BRIDGE_PORT/health"
```

Expected response contains `"status":"ok"`.

### In-app smoke test

1. Open app and verify Settings reports bridge connected
2. Set `Start Directory` from sidebar (optional)
3. Create a chat and send a prompt
4. Switch to Plan mode and send prompt that triggers clarifying options
5. Verify clarification flow can submit
6. Open Git from header and verify status/diff/commit/push behavior
7. Test attachment menu (`+`) with workspace path + phone file/image
8. Run long task and verify stop button interrupts run and transcript logs stop
9. Open `Browser`, enter `localhost:3000` or another active loopback dev port, and verify the page loads inside the app

## Chat Controls (Workspace, Model, Mode, Approvals)

### Choosing Start Directory

1. Open sidebar
2. Under `Start Directory`, pick either:
   - `Bridge default workspace`
   - a discovered workspace path from existing Codex chats
   - any folder on the bridge host via the built-in folder browser or manual path entry

Behavior:

- Applies to new chats
- Existing chats retain their own workspace unless changed

### Model and Slash Commands

Supported mobile slash commands:

- `/help`
- `/new`
- `/model [model-id]`
- `/plan [on|off|prompt]`
- `/status`
- `/rename <new-name>`
- `/compact`
- `/review`
- `/fork`
- `/diff`

### Plan Mode and Clarifications

- Plan mode is sent through `turn/start` via structured `collaborationMode`
- App can auto-switch to plan mode on plan events or when server requests it
- Structured clarifications open a dedicated modal
- Numbered plain-text options are rendered as tappable fallback choices

### Approval UX

Approval banner actions:

- `Deny`
- `Allow once`
- `Session`
- `Allow similar` (when available)

Approval events are surfaced via `bridge/approval.requested` and `bridge/approval.resolved`.

## NPM Release Automation

Workflow: `.github/workflows/npm-release.yml`

Required repo secret:

- `NPM_TOKEN`

Typical release flow (from `main`):

```bash
npm version patch
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

Automation verifies tag/version consistency and publishes to npm.
