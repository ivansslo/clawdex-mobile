# Troubleshooting

## Bridge startup seems slow

- `clawdex init` no longer starts Expo for the shipped app.
- Published npm installs should use a bundled bridge binary on `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, and `win32-x64`.
- `clawdex init` should not run a repo `npm install` on the published CLI path.
- Published CLI installs should not pull Expo/React Native or ship the mobile source tree.
- If startup is still compiling Rust, you are usually on a source checkout, an unsupported host, or a package without bundled bridge binaries.
- The slow parts are usually npm dependency install/repair or the first Rust bridge build on source-based setups.
- If you want to skip the interactive wizard after initial setup, use `npm run secure:bridge`.

## Expo starts but QR/network is wrong

- This only applies when you are developing the mobile app locally from the repo.
- Re-run `npm run secure:setup`
- Confirm `.env.secure` has correct `BRIDGE_HOST`
- Restart `npm run mobile`

## Stop all running services quickly

Preferred:

```bash
clawdex stop
```

From repo checkout:

```bash
npm run stop:services
```

## Bridge auth errors (`401`, invalid token)

- For the shipped mobile app, rescan the bridge QR or update the stored token in Settings.
- For GitHub-auth Codespaces profiles, reopen `GitHub Codespaces` in the app and sign in with GitHub again if the GitHub App token or refresh token was revoked or expired.
- For a local dev build, also ensure `BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env.secure` matches `EXPO_PUBLIC_HOST_BRIDGE_TOKEN` in `apps/mobile/.env`.
- Restart the bridge after token changes.
- On secure-launcher installs, `Settings > Bridge Maintenance > Restart bridge safely` can do that from the phone.
- If an in-app bridge update fails, inspect `.bridge-updater.log` and `.bridge-update-status.json` in the bridge install root.

## GitHub Codespaces bridge URL does not connect

- Pair to the printed forwarded HTTPS URL such as `https://<codespace>-8787.app.github.dev`, not `127.0.0.1`.
- Public forwarded ports reset back to private when the codespace restarts.
- Restart the bridge or rerun `npm run codespaces:bootstrap` to rerun the automatic visibility step.
- If needed, set both ports public manually:

```bash
gh codespace ports visibility 8787:public 8788:public
```

- If `gh` is unavailable in the codespace, use the Codespaces `Ports` panel and change both forwarded ports to `Public`.
- Keep bridge auth enabled. Public forwarded ports without bridge auth are not a safe setup.
- If GitHub direct sign-in is not showing in the app, confirm the build includes `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_SLUG`, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_AUTH_BASE_URL`.
- If the GitHub browser sheet returns but sign-in still fails, confirm the GitHub App callback URL is `https://<your-domain>/github/callback` and that `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation` is enabled.
- If the app signs in but still cannot create a Codespace or clone/push inside it, reopen the GitHub App access step in the app and make sure the template repo and any target repos are selected for the installation.
- If in-app Codespace creation forks or targets the wrong repo, check `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_REPO_NAME`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_SOURCE_OWNER`, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CODESPACES_REPO_REF` in the mobile build env.

## GitHub Codespaces bootstrap did not start the bridge

- Check the post-start command output in the Codespace terminal or rerun it manually:

```bash
npm run codespaces:bootstrap -- --prepare-only
npm run codespaces:bootstrap
```

- On the minimal `clawdex-codespace` template, rerun the packaged bootstrap instead:

```bash
CLAWDEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT="$PWD" node "$(npm root -g)/clawdex-mobile/scripts/codespaces-bootstrap.js" --prepare-only
CLAWDEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT="$PWD" node "$(npm root -g)/clawdex-mobile/scripts/codespaces-bootstrap.js"
```

- The Codespaces bootstrap only prepares the `codex` engine. It will try to install Codex automatically with `npm install -g @openai/codex`.
- `--prepare-only` installs Codex if needed and prebuilds the Rust bridge binary without starting the bridge.
- The bootstrap also enables `BRIDGE_GITHUB_CODESPACES_AUTH=true` so GitHub bearer tokens can connect directly to the bridge.
- If that install fails, fix npm/global package permissions in the codespace and rerun the bootstrap.
- Bridge startup logs and runtime state live in the Codespace repo root:

```bash
tail -n 200 .bridge.log
ls -la .bridge.pid .bridge.log .env.secure
```

- To only rewrite `.env.secure` without starting the bridge:

```bash
npm run codespaces:bootstrap -- --no-start
```

## Git push in a Codespace fails with `403` or permission denied

- The app now bootstraps GitHub HTTPS git credentials inside the Codespace after GitHub sign-in.
- If you signed in before this behavior shipped, reopen `GitHub Codespaces` in the app and sign in with GitHub once more so the saved token includes repository access.
- The bootstrap also rewrites common `git@github.com:...` and `ssh://git@github.com/...` remotes to HTTPS so they can use the same credential.
- After reconnecting, retry the clone/push from the app or from the Codespace shell.

## Voice transcription says no credentials were found

- The bridge can transcribe with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `BRIDGE_CHATGPT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, a legacy bridge token cache, or the Codex-managed ChatGPT token in `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`.
- In GitHub Codespaces, finish the Codex login step from the app first. Codex writes the login to `$HOME/.codex/auth.json`, and `.env.secure` sets `CODEX_HOME` to that persistent location.
- Current app builds automatically restart the Codespace Codex app-server after the Codex login step so it reloads the Codex auth home. On older builds, restart the bridge once after logging in:

```bash
npm run secure:bridge
```

- You can inspect whether Codex saved auth in the Codespace:

```bash
ls -la "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/auth.json"
```

## Codespace wakes but Codex says account authentication is required

- Codespaces should use Codex-managed auth, the same as a local bridge. The login is stored in `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/auth.json`.
- The app starts Codex's normal ChatGPT web login first. It captures the OAuth callback on the phone and forwards that callback to the Codex loopback server inside the Codespace, so device-code login is only a fallback.
- Run `source .env.secure && ls -la "$CODEX_HOME/auth.json"` in the Codespace to confirm the auth file exists.
- If the file is missing, reopen GitHub Codespaces setup in the app and complete the Codex login step once. After that, bridge restarts and Codespace wakes should not require reauthentication.

## Local browser preview does not open

- The in-app browser only supports loopback targets from the bridge host: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`.
- Use entries like `localhost:3000`, `127.0.0.1:5173`, or just a port number.
- If a separate local API runs on another port, make sure the app reaches it through `fetch`, XHR, `EventSource`, `WebSocket`, or a normal form post so the preview runtime can rewrite it through the bridge.
- See `docs/browser-preview-limitations.md` for the current support boundaries and known caveats.
- If Browser reports preview is unavailable, check whether `BRIDGE_PREVIEW_PORT` is already in use on the host.
- By default the preview server binds to `BRIDGE_PORT + 1`.
- Restart the bridge after changing `BRIDGE_PREVIEW_PORT`.
- If the page shell loads but live reload does not, verify the target dev server is still serving its WebSocket/HMR endpoint locally.
- In GitHub Codespaces, the preview port (`8788` by default) must also be public or the Browser screen will fail even if the main bridge port works.

## Tailscale issues

- Verify host and phone are on the same Tailscale network
- Check host IP (`tailscale ip -4`) and the bridge URL saved in the mobile app

## `codex` not found

- Ensure `codex` is in `PATH`
- Or set `CODEX_CLI_BIN` explicitly

## Bridge build fails with `linker 'cc' not found`

This only applies when the bridge is building from Rust source instead of using a bundled binary.

Install C build tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

Then retry `npm run secure:bridge`.

## iOS bundling error: `Unable to resolve "./BoundingDimensions"`

Manual recovery:

```bash
npm install --include=dev --force
npm install --include=dev --force -w apps/mobile
npm run -w apps/mobile start -- --clear
```

## Runtime errors: `[runtime not ready]` / `property is not writable`

Manual recovery:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules apps/mobile/node_modules
npm install --include=dev --force
npm install --include=dev --force -w apps/mobile
npm run -w apps/mobile start -- --clear
```

Also update Expo Go on your phone.

## Git operations fail

- Verify chat workspace is a valid git repo
- Verify remote auth/access for push

## Attachment upload issues

- Ensure mobile app has file/photo permissions
- File limit is `20 MB` per upload
- Uploads persist under `BRIDGE_WORKDIR/.clawdex-mobile-attachments`
- Ensure `BRIDGE_WORKDIR` is writable

## Worklets/Reanimated mismatch

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo install --fix
npm run start -- --clear
```

## Plan mode errors (`RPC-32600` invalid `collaborationMode`)

- Restart the app and reconnect to the bridge
- Ensure bridge/mobile revisions match
- Run API test if needed:

```bash
npm run -w apps/mobile test -- --runInBand src/api/__tests__/client.test.ts
```

## Stop button does not interrupt a run

- Ensure revision supports `turn/interrupt`
- If run already finished, stop button disappears by design
- Pull latest, restart bridge, then retry from the mobile app
