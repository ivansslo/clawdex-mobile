## Submission Snapshot

- App name: Clawdex
- Version / build: [fill in]
- Date prepared: [fill in]
- Primary reviewer contact: [name + email + phone]
- Time zone for live support: [time zone]

## What The App Does

Clawdex is a companion app for a bridge running on infrastructure the user controls.
The iPhone and iPad app connects to that bridge and lets the user:

- Start new Codex runs and continue existing threads
- Monitor run progress and respond to clarifications
- Review approvals, Git status, and diffs
- Create Git commits on the connected host
- Execute allowed terminal commands on the connected host
- Attach files or images from the workspace or device

The app does not provide a public multi-tenant shell service.

## Test Setup For Review

Reviewer should use a dedicated review bridge.

- Provide a publicly reachable bridge URL and token directly in App Store Connect review notes.
- Keep that bridge online during App Review hours.
- Do not submit with placeholder or expired host details.

Optional fallback if App Review specifically asks for self-host setup:

```bash
npm install -g clawdex-mobile@latest
clawdex init
```

Then:

- Start the bridge on a machine you control.
- Use the generated bridge URL and token.
- Pair from the app by scanning the bridge QR code or by entering the URL and token manually.

## Reviewer Walkthrough

1. Launch the app on iPhone or iPad.
2. On `Connect Your Bridge`, scan the bridge QR code or enter the provided bridge URL and token.
3. Tap `Test Connection`, then continue.
4. Start a new run or open an existing thread.
5. Send a prompt and confirm that a response is received.
6. Open the Git screen and verify status / diff rendering.
7. If prompted, review and approve an action.
8. To attach an image, use the add action in the composer and choose an image from the device.

## Security And Privacy Notes For Review

- Bridge auth token is required by default.
- The app is intended for trusted private networking such as LAN, VPN, or Tailscale.
- Any remote execution happens only on infrastructure controlled by the user or review account owner.
- Terminal commands are constrained by server-side allowlist controls and can be disabled entirely.
- In-app Privacy and Terms screens remain accessible from Settings.

## Push Notifications (new in 5.2.3)

- The user's self-hosted bridge sends push notifications when an agent turn completes or needs approval; the app's WebSocket closes when backgrounded, so the bridge is the sender.
- Delivery path: bridge → Expo push service → APNs (iOS) / FCM (Android).
- Notification payloads contain the event type, the bridge project (folder) name, and, for completed turns, a short preview of the agent's reply (last line, max 140 chars). No prompts, code, diffs, or tool output are sent.
- Notifications are controllable in Settings (master toggle + per-event toggles).
- Approval notifications include Approve/Deny actions that resolve the approval over the authenticated bridge connection.
- To exercise notifications during review: enable notifications, background the app, and trigger a turn on the review bridge.

## App Privacy / Data Safety Answers (reply preview)

Because a reply snippet leaves the device via Expo/APNs/FCM when notifications are on, declare:

- Data type: "Other user content" (a truncated snippet of assistant reply text) and a device push token (a non-advertising identifier used solely for notification routing).
- Linked to identity: No.
- Used for tracking: No.
- Purpose: App functionality (delivering notifications the user enabled).
- Optional: Yes — controlled by the in-app notifications toggle.

## Guideline Positioning Notes

- The app is for access to user-controlled infrastructure, not a shared cloud shell.
- The bridge dependency is disclosed during onboarding and in review notes.
- Reviewers do not need to create an external account when a review bridge URL and token are supplied.
